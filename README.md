# Double Vertical Slider

https://thedanitor.github.io/double_vertical_slider/

This project is from the Day 26 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Cool project. Really interesting way to push divs out of view and hiding them. Could make mobile-friendly by orienting everything horizontally instead of vertically. Would be cool to try.

### Things Learned

* Can use querySelector(All) inside an element rather than from document
* clientHeight property returns height of element
